(defn register-getter-sub
  "Provides an easy way to register a new subscription that just retrieves the
  value from a given location in app-db. Simply provide the query-key keyword
  designating the new subscription and the path in app-db to the new data of
  interest. Optionally, the value returned by the subscription's reaction may
  be the result of a function you provide a that takes as arguments the new
  value and elements in the subscription vector following the query key. For
  example, if we called

    (register-getter-sub :my-sub
                         [:path :in :app-db]
                         (fn [new-val up?]
                           (if up? (upper-case new-val) new-val)))

    (defn some-component []
      (let [the-word (subscribe [:my-sub true])]
        (fn ...

  Now, after executing something like

    (swap! app-db assoc-in [:path :in :app-db] \"new words\")

  some-component will render using \"NEW WORDS\" as the value from @the-word."
