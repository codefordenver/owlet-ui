  resulting reaction will be polled as if it were dereferrenced in the hiccup
  code of a component definition. Whenever it changes, its new value will be
  uploaded to the Firebase node. Note that the upload happens immediately with
  initial data.

  Important: For this function to work, you need to make sure that function

  running. This is the polling mechanism.

  This function is the inverse of on-change, sending data to the outside world.

  function as a way to set up a sort of VIRTUAL component to receive data from
